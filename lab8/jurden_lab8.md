### x86-64
1. Basic Information
  - Is the processor a RISC or a CISC architecture?
  - Describe the cache layout of the processor (name the processor model selected, if applicable).
  - Is this a fixed-width or variable-width instruction set?
2. Supported Data Types
  - What data types are supported?
  - What are the bit-widths of those data types
  - Are the data types stored in big-endian, little-endian, or some other format?
3. Register Set
  - Describe the number and type of registers available in the processor
  - What is the bit-width of each register?
4. Describe the instruction encodings for...
  - one Arithmetic instruction (Like Add, Mul)
  - one Memory Access instruction (Like load, store)
  - one Call instruction
  - one Conditional branch instruction
5. Is the instruction set zero-address, one-address, two-address, three-address or something else. Justify your answer?
