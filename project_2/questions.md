### Questions for Project 2

- in the `node()` call, what are the first two numbers referring to?
- `call` - see comments above function
- on `set` null cases, do we just throw an error? How do you handle?
- `ccor` - which false list do you go with?
- `exprs` - what do we return after we concatenate teh two s_links?
- General discussion of backpatch. What does the number correspond to, how does the backpatching work?


TODO:
- check every node first 2 args.
