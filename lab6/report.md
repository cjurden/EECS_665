1. Rather than specifically defining my operator production in the correct operator precedence order, or alternatively defining different productions for different levels of precedence, or alternatively still defining these using `%prec`. I wouldnt have to worry about any of this, could just define a single production and as long as all the operator tokens were there, in any order, yacc would figure it out for me.
